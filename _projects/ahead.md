**Ahead** is a task-centered GTD(Get Things Done) App on iOS platform. It aims to help people **schedule and organize** tasks, **track** progress and improvement and get **motivated**. It also features flexible late day* functionality, simple yet powerful category filters, eye-caring dark mode design and more. Public Testflight: [link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Daid4Yfu).

**Key Features**:

- 21-day task management and progress tracking keeps life and work organized and efficient.
- Strict *due day* mode plus *incomplete reminder* help stay motivated and say goodbye to procrastination.
- Up to 7 late days gives leeway to you and your tasks, with flexibility and accountability.
- Simple yet powerful filters let you navigate among multiple roles freely and confidently.
- Carefully-tuned system-wide Dark Mode. The auto switch follows your system preference or you can override the system setting if you like.

<!-- ### Problem Space
Uncertainty and changes are life constant, particularly during the pandemic and the work-from-home period. As those challenges emerge, the productivity plummets. Imagine: sitting in front of the computer, we are constantly interrupted by "BREAKING NEWS" on Twitter, disturbed by food or mail delivery calls, or even diverted by collegues' or friends' bombarding messages, etc. As a result, time and task management becomes a pressing topic for a lot of us. It is crucially important and necessary for everyone to stay not only mentally healthy but also productive and accountable to assigned tasks.

### User Research

### Design Questions
> How can we help people solve their pain point of low productivity, keep them motivated and focused while still maintain flexible yet accountable to their tasks?

> How our interfaces and interactions should look like to provide glanceable and personalized information?

### Reflection and Future Vision

<!-- Design wise -->
This project unveils a huge opportunity for me to explore and dive deep into the realm of software engineering and design while carrying out foundational HCI practices, such as interaction design, user research, and analysis that, in turn, drive the design of user interfaces and user flows. Because of the nature of this project, I have the chance to learn and practice key frameworks on iOS, such as UIKit and CocoaTouch, understanding their underlying intentions and interactions they afford, how combinations of UI elements contribute to or hurt overall user experience. It also gives me valuable resources to lay my hands on avant-garde technologies, such as SwiftUI.

<!-- Code wise -->
The development of this project creates a meaningful and valuable connection between academic concepts and real-world software engineering. Design patterns such as delegate, callback, observers, singleton offer me a lot of inspirations and flexibility when dealing with complex issues. Drawing parallels from and implementing module designs, generics and MVC patterns that are highlighted during classes allow me to write understandable, scalable, and changeable code when facing increased complexity.

<!-- Challenges -->
<!-- code -->
While this project offers various opportunities, it also poses serious challenges and uncovers many aspects that need dire changes. For instance, our app architecture experienced a drastic change due to ill and less effective communication with our design friend. And some expedient solutions I conceived require more modification to meet the standard software engineering practices. Combined, these challenges set a higher standard, pushing me to learn higher and more advanced techniques about software engineering in the future.


<!-- Future Vision -->
We have prepared a wide variety of features and functionalities drawing from the user research and we will add them incrementally to Ahead in the future. Features such as Widget in iOS 14, duplicate tasks more flexibly and easily are in our high priority list. Furthermore, we discovered that reinforcing good behaviors and improvements by offering small, staged rewards, even psychological rewards, can help users accomplish their goals one by one and create a sense of achievement for them to proceed further. Thus, we are preparing a statistics page that is fully customizable and visually appealing and a reward system that advocates better habits and can be shared and competed among friends.

Stay tuned! -->
