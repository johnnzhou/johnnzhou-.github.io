Husky Mask Exchange is a group research project in my Human-Computer Interation Capstone course. We are designing a system that fosters virtual and physical connections, bridges different cultures and facilitates communications within UW comunity under the pandemic by exchaging homemade masks with paired partners. The entire project is based on React, React Native, JavaScript, CSS. We conducted various user researches, including contextual inquries and semi-structured interviews to find insights that drive our project. We also conducted multiple usability testing to make sure the product is making sense to our target users.
