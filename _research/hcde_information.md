This is an ongoing research project co-led by [Professor Gary Hsieh](http://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/), [Professor Kate Starbird](http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/) and PhD candidate Himanshu Zade in Human Centered Design & Engineering Department. We are investigating solutions for improving the quality of online participation on social media. Specifically, we are exploring whether providing contextual details about the content (e.g. information about the other accounts that have shared this content) affects your decisions to re-post information.
