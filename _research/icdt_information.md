This is an ongoing research project led by [Professor Kurtis Heimerl](https://kurti.sh/) and PhD student Esther Jang in the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at UW. We are investigating solutions to improve the local cellular network conditions in low-income, rural communities in Seattle areas.
