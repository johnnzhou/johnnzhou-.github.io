Hi, I'm Zhennan(John) Zhou. Currently, I'm a senior at the [University of Washington, Seattle](https://www.uw.edu), majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in Human-Computer Interactions, Software Engineering, Human-Centered Design and Computing in general. In my part time, I'm also an indie and dedicated iOS developer. 

I am currently an undergraduate research assistant at the Information and Communication Technologies for Development [(ICTD)](https://ictd.cs.washington.edu) Lab in Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at UW supervised by [Professor Kurtis Heimerl](https://kurti.sh/) and PhD student Esther Jang. We are working on improving the local cellular network conditions in low-income, rural communities around Seattle area.  

I also co-develop an Task Management App called [**Ahead**](https://johnnzhou.github.io/projects/ahead) on iOS platform, which helps people schedule and organize their daily tasks, keep track of progress and improvements as well as give them motivation to keep going and get rid of procrastination habit.
