Hi, I'm Zhennan(John) Zhou. Currently, I'm a senior from [University of Washington, Seattle](www.uw.edu), majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in Human-Computer Interactions, Human-Centered Design and Computing in general. In my part time, I'm also an indie iOS developer. 

I am currently an undergraduate research assistant in Human Centered Design & Engineering at UW under Professor Kate Starbird and PhD candidate Himanshu Zade's research group. We are working on investigating solutions for improving the quality of online participation, particularly on Twitter.
