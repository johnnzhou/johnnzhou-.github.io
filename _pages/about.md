Hi, I'm Zhennan(John) Zhou. Currently, I'm a senior at the [University of Washington, Seattle](https://www.uw.edu), majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in Human-Computer Interactions, Software Engineering, Human-Centered Design and Computing in general. In my part time, I'm also an indie and dedicated iOS developer. 

I am currently an undergraduate research assistant at emCOMP Lab in Human-Centered Design & Engineering at UW supervised by [Professor Kate Starbird](http://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/), [Professor Gary Hsieh](http://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/), and PhD candidate Himanshu Zade. We are working on investigating solutions for improving the quality of online participation, particularly on Twitter.  

I also co-develop an Task Management App called [**Ahead**](https://johnnzhou.github.io/projects/ahead) on iOS platform, which helps people schedule and organize their daily tasks, keep track of progress and improvements as well as give them motivation to keep going and get rid of procrastination habit.
