Hi, I'm Zhennan(John) Zhou. Currently, I'm a first year BS/MS student at the [University of Washington, Seattle](https://www.uw.edu), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu/). I'm interested in HCI, Software Engineering, Human-Centered Design and Computing in general. Human-computer interactions and interfaces are what I'm most fascinated with. Joyful interfaces and interactions can empower individuals to accomplish goals and society as a whole. That's how I'm motivated and guided to study software engineering design theory and implementation, HCI as well as various other realms in computer science. I very enjoy my interdisciplinary and is striving for mixing both into my career path.

I am currently a graduate researcher at Local Connectivity Lab under the Information and Communication Technologies for Development [(ICTD)](https://ictd.cs.washington.edu) Lab in Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at UW supervised by [Professor Kurtis Heimerl](https://kurti.sh/) and PhD student [Esther Jang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~infrared/). We are working on improving the local cellular network conditions in low-income, rural communities around Seattle area.  

In my free time, I'm also an indie and dedicated iOS developer. I co-develop an Task Management App called [Ahead](https://johnnzhou.github.io/projects/ahead) on iOS platform, which helps people schedule and organize their daily tasks, keep track of progress and improvements as well as give them motivation to keep going and get rid of procrastination habit.
